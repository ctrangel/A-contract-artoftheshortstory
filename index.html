        <h1>Sea Oak</h1>
        <p>George Saunders is a critically acclaimed American author from Chicago. His
short story Sea Oak, first published in 1999, offers an interesting mix of comedy,
mystery, drama, and zombies. This story includes a number of incredibly authentic and
memorable characters. However, it makes sense to focus in on the main family. This
family lives in a small apartment in a not-so-glamorous subsidized housing complex.
The narrator works as a male stripper at the strip club just over and through the strip of
forest by their apartment. Then there’s the narrator’s sister, Min, and their cousin, Jade.
Not the brightest those two, but they mean well. They are also both single mothers, with
Troy being Min’s little boy and Mac being Jade’s. Neither of them has a job. They mostly
sit around watching TV all day. The last one in the apartment is their aunt, Bernie. She’s
the sweetest character with the most pitiful life. She somehow manages to find joy in the
tiniest things while living a life of complete disparity. She’s an older woman in her
sixties, works most days for little money, and has never had children or even a lover of
her own. This quote is one of many that give a good glimpse into this family, “For dinner
it's beanie-wienies. For dessert it's ice cream with freezer burn. ‘What a nice day we've
had,’ Aunt Bernie says once we've got the babies in bed. ‘Man, what an optometrist,’ says
Jade.”(Saunders 95)<br>
<pre></pre>It’s also important to throw in the narrator’s mother, who’s also Bernie’s sister,
and her ‘man,’ Freddie, the phone poller. This passage sums up Freddie pretty well,
“Dad's dead and left us nada, and Ma now lives with Freddie, who doesn't like us, plus
he's not exactly rich himself. He does phone polls. This month, he's asking divorced
women how often they backslide and sleep with their exes. He gets ten bucks for every
completed poll.” (Saunders 97) Ma and Freddie only come around after Bernie
suddenly passes away in the apartment from quite literally being frightened to death. To
sum up the plot, Bernie comes back to life as a zombie, but she doesn’t come back as the
same old cheerful, sweet aunt they knew before. She comes back with fury and
vengeance. In her necrotic state, she lashes out at them, ordering them around and
laying out her grand plan in phases. For phase one, she looks at Jade: ‘Get a job!’ She
looks at Min: ‘Learn how to cook!’ Then she looks at the narrator: ‘Show your cock!’
This new Bernie doesn’t play around. She’s no longer laying down and taking the shit
that life throws at her and the family. She’s going to uplift this family with everything
she can and also get herself a lover! Sadly, her second life begins to quickly rot away.
Quite literally, she begins to quickly fall apart until she’s just a resentful head. Her
parting words are a true testament to this fantastic story, as seen in this passage. “‘Why
do some people get everything and I got nothing?’ she says. ‘Why? Why was that?’ ‘I
don't know,’ I say. ‘Show your cock,’ she says, and dies again.” (Saunders 123) In Sea
Oak, there are aspects of comedy, drama, mystery, and zombies. Saunders does an
incredible job blending multiple different genres into one cohesive narrative that still 
manages to create a wildly funny, dramatic, and impactful storyline.</p>
